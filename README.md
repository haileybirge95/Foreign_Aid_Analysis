# Foreign Aid Analysis

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions regarding the impact of foreign aid on developing countries in Africa: How is foreign aid distributed? Is there a relationship between foreign aid and mortality? And finally, is population distribution related to foreign aid?

The analysis is based on data collected by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. Department of State, and World Bank Data. Included are 32 developing countries in the African continent, and the data spans from 2000-2022.
The significance of the results is determined by statistical testing include linear regression, p-values, and t-values.

For this analysis we used two sets of data:
1- Nasdaq World Bank - WB_DATA_d950d0cd269a601150c0afd03b234ee2.csv
2- Kaggle - us_foreign_aid_country

The data file from Kaggle is a subset of the Nasdaq World Bank data file.

In order to use the large data file from the World Bank, we had to apply several reductions.
The reduction was done mainly by the "WB_data_upd.py". 
The following files used in the code that were too big to upload to the repository are:
1- WB_DATA_d950d0cd269a601150c0afd03b234ee2.csv >> 457,442 KB
2- WB_africadata.csv >> 56,805 KB
3- WB_africadata_2000.csv >> 30,675 KB
