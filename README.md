# Foreign Aid Analysis

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions regarding the impact of foreign aid on developing countries in Africa: How is foreign aid distributed? Is there a relationship between foreign aid and mortality? And finally, is population distribution related to foreign aid?

The significance of the results is determined by statistical testing include linear regression, p-values, and t-values.
